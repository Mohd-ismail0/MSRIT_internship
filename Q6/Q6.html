        <div class="text">S Marie Curie, née Maria Sklodowska, was
        born in Warsaw on November 7, 1867, the daughter of a secondary-school teacher. She received a general
        education in local schools and some scientific training from her father. She became involved in a
        students’ revolutionary organization and found it prudent to leave Warsaw, then in the part of Poland
        dominated by Russia, for Cracow, which at that time was under Austrian rule. In 1891, she went to Paris to
        continue her studies at the Sorbonne where she obtained Licenciateships in Physics and the
        Mathematical Sciences. She met Pierre Curie, Professor in the School of Physics in 1894 and in the following
        year they were married.
